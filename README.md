 Add a new blog post.<br>
 Edit the blog post.<br>
 Delete the blog post

#Note:
 Feel free to enhance the UI experience. Wireframes shown below 
are just for your reference.<br>
 Usage of bootstrap or materialize is allowed but not their JS part.<br>
 Styling can be done using CSS/sass/less.<br>
 You should use ExpressJS in this application.<br>
 If you feel that you need to explain what you have done in <br>
the application, you can update the README.md<br>
